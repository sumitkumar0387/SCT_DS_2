# 🚢 Task 02 - Titanic Dataset Analysis (EDA & Data Cleaning)

This task is part of the *SkillCraft Technology Data Science Internship*.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To perform *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* and *Data Cleaning* on the Titanic dataset to understand survival patterns and prepare the data for further modeling.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- *Python*
- *Pandas* – for data cleaning and manipulation
- *Matplotlib* & *Seaborn* – for visualizations
- *Jupyter Notebook* – for writing and running code

---

## 📁 Project Files

- '[Task02_Titanic_EDA.ipynb'](/Task02_Titanic_EDA.ipynb.ipynb) – Jupyter notebook containing all code and analysis
- ['Titanic_cleaned.csv'](/Titanic_cleaned.csv) – Cleaned dataset after preprocessing

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately (e.g., imputing Age, Embarked)
- Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., Ticket, Cabin)
- Explored survival rates by *gender, **passenger class, and **family size*
- Visualized important patterns using bar charts and heatmaps
